### Built with

- Basic semantic HTML
- Basic CSS
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I think a good idea would be to create an image zoom area around the pointer. I can learn to apply it to the project, but because this project is still in the newbie category, I don't think it's necessary yet. In the future when I make more difficult projects, I will be able to use this effect.
